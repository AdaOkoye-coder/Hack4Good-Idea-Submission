# Volunteer Arts & Yoga for Senior Well-Being

Coordinate yoga, music, and dance volunteers to run uplifting sessions in senior homesâ€”with matching, scheduling, reminders, mobile check-ins, and simple impact feedback.

# Why it matters
Seniors benefit from routine social and creative engagement, but coordinating people is hard. This idea removes manual back-and-forth so more sessions happen, with less friction for staff and volunteers.
